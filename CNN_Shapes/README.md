## Overview

This repository contains code that demonstrates how to implement:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from images.
- **Transposed Convolutional Layers**: Upsample feature maps.
- **Max Pooling Layers**: Reduce the dimensionality of feature maps.
- **Flattening**: Convert multi-dimensional tensors into one-dimensional.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations are provided to illustrate the differences and similarities between the two frameworks.
